# Health-Monitoring-System
The code checks vital signs—heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and SpO2—against predefined normal ranges. Each vital sign's status is labeled "Normal" or "Abnormal". The `displayStatus` function then prints a report of these statuses with a message wishing good health. This ensures a clear, concise health monitoring report.
